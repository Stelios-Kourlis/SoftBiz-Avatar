Short answer is that this model has the avatar skeleton that the animations use.
Removing it and assigning another skeleton breaks the animations.
Maybe it is because this was a T1 avaturn avatar without facial animation support
and the animation also dont have facial animations
Trying to use the other model's avatar creates error about facial animation
